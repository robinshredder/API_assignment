# API-Library_assignment
API/JS Library assignment for course Programming 2 @ MAU

Chosen library: Anime JS

This is a simple demo of some of the functions of the lightweight JavaScript animation library Anime (http://animejs.com/).

<br>

# To see the demo in action
The demo files are in the folder called "form".
If you use Visual Studio code (VSC) to open up the files, you can use the Live Server extension in VSC to start a temporary server from your own computer, enabling the browser to open up the demo.

<br>

# Installation of library
(same guide can be found on Anime JS GitHub page)

To install AnimeJS from GitHub, go to: https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime 

Using node: <br>
$ npm install animejs <br>
 OR <br>
$ bower install animejs <br>
import anime from 'animejs' <br>
<br>

Or manually download and link anime.min.js in your HTML:
<script src="anime.min.js"></script>

<br>

# This demo

Our demo is a webpage made to show some basic functions of Anime Js in different combinations, like button animation, moving elements around and gradient color changing.

We have built upon Mikael Ainalems CodePen example (https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/EQXjOR) to have a starting form to work with, adding our own elements, animations and functions to show more of the library. The "Snake Highlight" is Mikal Ainalem's work, but we wanted to keep it and showcase it as a nice example of what you can do with Anime JS.
