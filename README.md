# API-Library_assignment
API/JS Library assignment for course Programming 2 @ MAU

Chosen library: Anime JS

This is a simple demo of some of the functions of the lightweight JavaScript animation library Anime (http://animejs.com/).

<br>

# Installation of library
(same guide can be found on Anime JS GitHub page)

To install AnimeJS from GitHub, go to: https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime 

Using node: <br>
$ npm install animejs <br>
 OR <br>
$ bower install animejs <br>
import anime from 'animejs' <br>
<br>

Or manually download and link anime.min.js in your HTML:
<script src="anime.min.js"></script>

<br>

# This demo

Our demo is a webpage made to show some basic functions of Anime Js in different combinations, like button animation, moving elements around and gradient color changing.

We have built upon Mikael Ainalems CodePen example (https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/EQXjOR) to have a starting form to work with, adding our own elements, animations and functions to show more of the library. The "Snake Highlight" is Mikal Ainalem's work, but we wanted to keep it and showcase it as a nice example of what you can do with Anime JS.


# To see the demo in action
Download the demo files and Anime JS ( https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime ), and open them up in your choice of code editor. In the demo's HTML-file, you need to make sure that you change the script src to link to where you've downloaded Anime JS so that the library is read.

Example: <script src="downloads/AnimeJS/anime-master/anime.min.js"></script>    

An alternative is to copy the anime.min.js file from the library's "anime-master" folder, into the same folder as the demo files. If you choose this method, you don't have to change anything in the HTML-file.

If you use Visual Studio code (VSC) to open up the files, you can use the Live Server extension in VSC to start a temporary server from your own computer, enabling the browser to open up the demo.
